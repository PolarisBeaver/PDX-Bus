<h1>TriMet Graphics</h1>
The graphics files in this folder are from TriMet and are not re-distributable. 

<ul>
<li>The visittrimeticon.gif file is available from the TriMet page about linking:  
<a href="http://www.trimet.org/help/linking.htm">http://www.trimet.org/help/linking.htm</a>.</li>
<li>The map of the rail system, railsystem.gif, is a 3000x1185 gif file made
from the PDF of the rail map.  
(The size here is important for the positioning of the hotspots). The original 
file is available here -
 <a href="http://www.trimet.org/maps/railsystem.htm">http://www.trimet.org/maps/railsystem.htm</a> 
 - I was granted special permission to use it for PDX Bus with a disclaimer - 
 you will need to ask permission if you want to distribute it
 in some way.  Note that I took the PDF and made the GIF file - the GIF 
 file provided by TriMet is too small
 and will not work.</li>
